# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

Simulates the Monty Hall Problem to explore statistical properties and showcase the Central Limit Theorem by displaying how results cluser around expected probabilities with multiple trials. 

monty_hall.py: simulates the Monty Hall problem under a specified number of iterations and various conditions.

visulizations.py: runs the simulations and visualizes the results using Seaborn. The x-axis represents the numbers of games played and the y-axis shows the win percentage.
